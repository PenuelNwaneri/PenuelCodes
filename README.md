### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


  <h3 align="center">My name is Penuel Nwaneri.</h3>

<p align="center">
I am an independent JavaScript Engineer and a great lover of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Node](https://github.com/nodejs).Most of my work is open source and publicly available on GitHub. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/home) where I mostly tweet about react and fullstack technologies.

If you happen to know any open source project,You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/penuel-nwaneri-8b4690195).

If I'm not coding or tweeting, I'm probably looking at charts and trading digital currencies.
