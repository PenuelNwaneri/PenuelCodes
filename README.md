### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 
I once wrote a great program. It printed "hello world" to the console. Ever since then, my code has been getting progressively better.Every night when I go to bed, I calculate exactly how long it will be till Iâ€™m writing code again. 


I value learning from others, genuine connections and hearing about other people's passion and how I can possibly help. 
Two of my favorite Programming books are You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures  by Kyle Simpson and  Speaking JavaScript: An In-Depth Guide for Programmers by Axel Rauschmayer.




Do you know any cool open-source projects that requires my skill set?
