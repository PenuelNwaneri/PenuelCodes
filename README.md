**Hey, I'm Penuel! ðŸ‘‹**


 

I am an independent JavaScript Engineer and a great lover of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Node](https://github.com/nodejs). <br>
Most of my work is open source and publicly available on GitHub. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/home) where I mostly tweet about react and fullstack technologies.




If you happen to know any open source project that requires my skillset,You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/penuel-nwaneri-8b4690195).

If I'm not coding or tweeting, I'm probably looking at charts and trading digital currencies.
