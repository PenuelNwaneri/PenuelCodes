### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Penuel Nwaneri.

I am an independent JavaScript Engineer and a great lover of  react.js and node.js. Most of my work is open source and publicly available on GitHub. You can follow me on Twitter where I mostly tweet about react and fullstack technologies.




If you happen to know any open source project,You can also find me on LinkedIn.

If I'm not coding or tweeting, I'm probably looking at charts and trading digital currencies.
