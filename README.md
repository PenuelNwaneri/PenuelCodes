**Hi there** ðŸ‘‹



I am a Software Engineer. skilled in cross platform development using technologies such as React, typescript, Nodejs , express.js, Graphql, MongoDB, firebase.
Most of my work is open source and publicly available on GitHub.

If I'm not coding or tweeting, I'm probably reasoning out solutions to a crossword puzzle.
